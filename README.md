# Blockly XML to HTML parser
A very simple Python based HTML parser for Blockly's exported XML files

## Usage
First install the libraries needed for running the program (indicated on requirements.txt).
Import the library from 'library.xml' on the <a href=https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html#>Blockly Block Factory</a> and create your blocks on the Workspace factory. Export them an XML file.
Then:

* Make sure your Blockly exported XML is on the same route of the parser and is named 'map.xml'
* If you want to apply styles to the formulary, the CSS file should be named 'styles.css'

The default names can be changed by renaming the string on the script.
